                    <h3>Agreement To Terms</h3>

                    <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether
                        personally or
                        on behalf of an entity (“you”) and WV Realty Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”), concerning your access
                        to and
                        use of the [www.wvrealtyny.com] website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile
                        website
                        or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the
                        “Site”). </p>

                    <p>You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of
                        these
                        Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with all of these Terms and Conditions, then you are
                        expressly
                        prohibited from using the Site and you must discontinue use immediately.

                        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time
                        are
                        hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion,
                        to make
                        changes or modifications to these Terms and Conditions at any time and for any reason. </p>

                    <p>We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms and
                        Conditions,
                        and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change.</p>

                    <p>
                        It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms and Conditions to stay informed of
                        updates.
                        You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the
                        changes
                        in any revised Terms and Conditions by your continued use of the Site after the date such
                        revised Terms
                        and Conditions are posted. <br> <br>

                        The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
                        entity
                        in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
                        regulation or
                        which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. <br>
                        <br>

                        Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own
                        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local
                        laws
                        are applicable. <br><br>

                        <b>Counter Notification</b>

                        If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result of a
                        mistake
                        or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification to [us/our Designated
                        Copyright
                        Agent] using the contact information provided below (a “Counter Notification”). <br> <br>

                        To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include
                        substantially the following:

                            your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial

                        <li>(3) a statement that you will accept service of process from the party that filed the
                            Notification or the party's agent;</li>

                        <li>(4) your name, address, and telephone number;</li>

                        <li>(5) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material
                            in question was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the
                            material to be removed or disabled;</li>

                        <li>(6) your physical or electronic signature.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the requirements described above,
                        we will restore your removed or disabled material, unless we first receive notice from the party
                        filing the Notification informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you
                        from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question. <br> <br>

                        Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed
                        by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's
                        fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury. <br> <br>

                        such right or provision. <br> <br>

                        These Terms and Conditions operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any

                        control. <br> <br>

                        unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable
                        from these Terms and Conditions and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
                        remaining provisions. <br> <br>

                        and Conditions and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms and
