                    <p>WV Realty Inc. is committed to equal opportunity and non-discrimination in all aspects of the
                        housing
                        related services they provide. The Company expressly prohibits any form of discrimination based
                        on a
                        person's actual or perceived gender (including gender identity), race, color, religion, national
                        origin,
                        age, disability, lawful occupation, presence of children, sexual orientation, marital status,
                        partnership status, citizenship status, lawful source of income or any other factor illegal
                        under
                        federal, state or city law (any of which is an "Unlawful Category"). Any discrimination based on
                        an
                        Unlawful Category by agents or employees in the performance of their expected job duties will
                        not be
                        tolerated and will subject the agent or employee to appropriate disciplinary or other measures.

                    <br>
                    <h3>Fair Housing Rights And Obligations</h3>

                    <p>
                        It is illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing, including against individuals
                        seeking a
                        mortgage or housing assistance, or in other housing-related activities. The Fair Housing Act
                        prohibits
                        this discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and
                        disability. A variety of other federal civil rights laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights
                        Act,
                        Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, prohibit
                        discrimination
                        in housing and community development programs and activities, particularly those that are
                        assisted with
                        HUD funding. These civil rights laws include obligations such as taking reasonable steps to
                        ensure
                        meaningful access to their programs and activities for persons with limited English proficiency
                        (LEP)
                        and taking appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with individuals with
                        disabilities
                        through the provision of appropriate auxiliary aids and services. Various federal fair housing
                        and civil
                        rights laws require HUD and its program participants to affirmatively further the purposes of
                        the Fair
                        Housing Act. <br> <br>

                        HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) works to eliminate housing
                        discrimination and
                        promote civil rights and economic opportunity through housing. FHEO enforces fair housing laws.
                        One of
                        its roles is to investigate complaints of housing discrimination. If you believe you have been
                        discriminated against in violation of any of these federal fair housing laws, you can file a
                        complaint
                        with FHEO.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Fair Housing Act</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Fair Housing Act protects people from discrimination when they are renting or buying a home,
                        getting
                        a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities.
                        Additional
                        protections apply to federally-assisted housing.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>History of Fair Housing</h3>

                    <p>
                        On April 11, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which was meant
                        as a
                        follow-up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1968 Act expanded on previous acts and prohibited
                        discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion,
                        national
                        origin, sex, (and as amended) handicap and family status. Title VIII of the Act is also known as
                        the
                        Fair Housing Act (of 1968). <br> <br>

                        The enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act on April 11, 1968 came only after a long and
                        difficult
                        journey. From 1966-1967, Congress regularly considered the fair housing bill, but failed to
                        garner a
                        strong enough majority for its passage. However, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was
                        assassinated on April 4, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson utilized this national tragedy to urge
                        for the
                        bill's speedy Congressional approval. Since the 1966 open housing marches in Chicago, Dr. King's
                        name
                        had been closely associated with the fair housing legislation. President Johnson viewed the Act
                        as a
                        fitting memorial to the man's life work, and wished to have the Act passed prior to Dr. King's
                        funeral
                        in Atlanta. <br> <br>

                        Another significant issue during this time period was the growing casualty list from Vietnam.
                        The deaths
                        in Vietnam fell heaviest upon young, poor African-American and Hispanic infantrymen. However, on
                        the
                        home front, these men's families could not purchase or rent homes in certain residential
                        developments on
                        account of their race or national origin. Specialized organizations like the NAACP, the National
                        Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB), the GI Forum, and the National Committee Against
                        Discrimination In Housing lobbied hard for the Senate to pass the Fair Housing Act and remedy
                        this
                        inequity. Senators Edward Brooke and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts argued deeply for the
                        passage of
                        this legislation. In particular, Senator Brooke, the first African-American ever to be elected
                        to the
                        Senate by popular vote, spoke personally of his return from World War II and inability to
                        provide a home
                        of his choice for his new family because of his race. <br> <br>

                        With the cities rioting after Dr. King's assassination, and destruction mounting in every part
                        of the
                        United States, the words of President Johnson and Congressional leaders rang the Bell of Reason
                        for the
                        House of Representatives, who subsequently passed the Fair Housing Act. Without debate, the
                        Senate
                        followed the House in its passage of the Act, which President Johnson then signed into law. <br>
                        <br>

                        The power to appoint the first officials administering the Act fell upon President Johnson's
                        successor,
                        Richard Nixon. President Nixon tapped then Governor of Michigan, George Romney, for the post of
                        Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. While serving as Governor, Secretary Romney had
                        successfully
                        campaigned for ratification of a state constitutional provision that prohibited discrimination
                        in
                        housing. President Nixon also appointed Samuel Simmons as the first Assistant Secretary for
                        Equal
                        Housing Opportunity. <br> <br>

                        When April 1969 arrived, HUD could not wait to celebrate the Act's 1st Anniversary. Within that
                        inaugural year, HUD completed the Title VIII Field Operations Handbook, and instituted a
                        formalized
                        complaint process. In truly festive fashion, HUD hosted a gala event in the Grand Ballroom of
                        New York's
                        Plaza Hotel. From across the nation, advocates and politicians shared in this marvelous evening,
                        including one of the organizations that started it all -- the National Committee Against
                        Discrimination
                        In Housing. <br> <br>

                        In subsequent years, the tradition of celebrating Fair Housing Month grew larger and larger.
                        Governors
                        began to issue proclamations that designated April as "Fair Housing Month," and schools across
                        the
                        country sponsored poster and essay contests that focused upon fair housing issues. Regional
                        winners from
                        these contests often enjoyed trips to Washington, DC for events with HUD and their Congressional
                        representatives. <br> <br>

                        Under former Secretaries James T. Lynn and Carla Hills, with the cooperation of the National
                        Association
                        of Homebuilders, National Association of Realtors, and the American Advertising Council these
                        groups
                        adopted fair housing as their theme and provided "free" billboard space throughout the nation.
                        These
                        large 20-foot by 14-foot billboards placed the fair housing message in neighborhoods, industrial
                        centers, agrarian regions and urban cores. Every region also had its own celebrations, meetings,
                        dinners, contests and radio-television shows that featured HUD, state and private fair housing
                        experts
                        and officials. These celebrations continue the spirit behind the original passage of the Act,
                        and are
                        remembered fondly by those who were there from the beginning.

                    <h3>Who Is Protected?</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Race</li>
                        <li>Color</li>

                    <h3>What Types of Housing Are Covered?</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Fair Housing Act covers most housing. In very limited circumstances, the Act exempts
                        owner-occupied
                        buildings with no more than four units, single-family houses sold or rented by the owner without
                        the use
                        of an agent, and housing operated by religious organizations and private clubs that limit
                        occupancy to
                        members.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to harass persons because of race, color,
                        religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin. Among other things,
                        this forbids sexual harassment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Other Prohibitions:</b>

                    <h3>Coverage</h3>

                    <p>
                        This policy covers all Company employees and agents without exception. The Company will
                        not tolerate,
                        condone or allow discrimination, whether engaged in by clients, employees, agents.
                        independent
                        contractors or other non-employees who conduct business with the Company. While the
                        Company's ability to
                        control clients and third parties is limited, this does not diminish the obligation of
                        the Company's
                        agents and employees to comply with the law and this Policy.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Education and Procedures</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Company engages in periodic training of employees and agents on the
                        anti-discrimination laws and has
                        had prepared the attached summary of the pertinent anti-discrimination laws covering the
                        Company's
                        activities as manager, sales, and leasing agent of housing. It requires all managers and
                        sales and
                        leasing agents to review the laws. Any questions or issues concerning discrimination
                        should be addressed
                        to the Company's in house counsel; reports and complaints will be kept confidential to
                        the fullest
                        extent possible without impairing the Company's obligations to comply with the law.
                        Where necessary, the
                        Company may employ an outside lawyer or consultant to investigate a question and provide
                        guidance in
                        handling the matter.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Retalliation Prohibited</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Company will not in any way retaliate against an individual who makes a report of
                        discrimination or
                        provides information concerning such actions nor will it permit any employee or agent to
                        do so.
                        Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy and should be reported immediately.
                        Any person found
                        to have retaliated against another individual for reporting unlawful discrimination will
                        be subject to
                        the same disciplinary action provided for offenders.
